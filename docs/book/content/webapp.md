# Web Application

`Cost-of-Capital-Calculator` can be run via the Python API described in this document or through a GUI web application.  The online interface is hosted through [Compute Studio](https://compute.studio) and is available at [https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Cost-of-Capital-Calculator/](https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Cost-of-Capital-Calculator/).

On the web application, users are able to enter changes to business income taxes and individual income taxes.  The results page displays graphical output showing have $METR$'s change across industry and assets.  A summary table is also displayed and full model output is available for download.
